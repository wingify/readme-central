By default, a new Fullstack campaign considers the campaign ID while bucketing a user using its user ID. This helps in providing a much better experience to a user when the same user becomes a part of multiple similar campaigns. Disabling this option means a user will be exposed to the same variation of different similar campaigns.

> ðŸ“˜ Similar Campaigns
>
> When traffic distribution, number of variations, and their respective weights of two or more campaigns are the same, they are referred to as *similar campaigns*. Pre-segmentation, whitelisting, or other things could vary.

> ðŸš§ Please Note
>
> Once a campaign is started i.e. running, paused, or archived, this option can not be toggled for that campaign. This helps in providing a consistent experience to an already bucketed user throughout the journey of a campaign.
