Using the Mutually Exclusive Groups option in VWO, you can group multiple campaigns together that are mutually exclusive. By ensuring visitors do not overlap multiple campaigns, you can ensure that the same visitor does not see the unrelated campaign variations. This eliminates the interaction effects that multiple campaigns could have with each other. Improvements in conversion rate can be attributed to the right campaign and remove bias.

## Set Up Mutually Exclusive Groups

To create a mutually exclusive group at the account level:

* Click the gear icon âš™ on the top right, and go to CAMPAIGN SETTINGS.
* Under the Mutually Exclusive Groups section, click Create mutually exclusive group.

* Click Create Campaign Group.
