This section serves as a comprehensive guide for developers looking to implement VWO's Feature Management & Experimentation capabilities in their applications. Through a consistent example application implemented across various programming languages, we showcase the versatility and ease of integration of VWO FME in both server-side and client-side environments.

## Purpose

* Demonstrate VWO FME integration patterns across multiple programming languages
* Showcase both server-side and client-side implementation approaches
* Provide practical, real-world examples using a consistent demo application
* Help developers understand FME capabilities and best practices

## Core Features Demonstrated

* üéØ User ID-based feature flag evaluation
* üö¶ Feature flag status checking
* üîÑ Real-time settings visualization
* üìä SDK log monitoring
* üåê Interactive web interface
* üìà Event tracking capabilities
* üé® User attributes management

## Why A Specific Example?

We've chosen a simple yet practical application to demonstrate FME capabilities consistently across all implementations. This approach allows developers to:

* Understand core concepts regardless of programming language
* Compare implementations across different technologies
* Quickly adapt the examples to their specific use cases
* Learn best practices for FME integration

## Key Benefits

* **Consistent Example**: Same application logic across all implementations
* **Clear Integration Patterns**: Well-documented integration approaches
* **Best Practices**: Production-ready code following language-specific standards
* **Complete Features**: Full demonstration of VWO FME capabilities

## Getting Started

1. Choose your preferred technology implementation
2. Follow the setup instructions in the respective directory
3. Explore the example application
4. Adapt the patterns to your specific use case
