## Manage Feature Flags Programmatically with REST APIs

The Feature Management and Experimentation (FME) REST APIs allow you to programmatically **create, retrieve, update, and delete** feature flags. These APIs also enable you to configure and manage targeting rules associated with feature flags, including the following rule types:

* Rollout – Gradually release a feature to a percentage of users.
* A/B Test – Run experiments by serving different feature variations to user segments.
* Personalize – Deliver customized experiences based on user attributes or context.

### Benefits of Using the REST APIs

By leveraging the FME REST APIs, developers gain full control over feature flag lifecycle management without relying on the web interface. This approach is particularly beneficial for:

* Automating flag and rule configuration as part of CI/CD pipelines
* Managing feature releases at scale
* Enabling infrastructure-as-code practices for experimentation and feature management
* Reducing dependency on manual UI operations, improving deployment efficiency and consistency
* These APIs empower teams to integrate feature flag operations seamlessly into their development workflows, enhancing agility and operational flexibility.
