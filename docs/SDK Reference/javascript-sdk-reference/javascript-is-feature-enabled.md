After successfully [instantiating](https://developers.vwo.com/docs/javascript-launch) a VWO class, _isFeatureEnabled API_ returns whether a feature is enabled for the campaign(for Feature Rollout) / campaign's variation(for Feature Test) for a specified user and for a running campaign.

In the case of a Feature Rollout campaign, a boolean value is returned based on whether a user qualifies for a campaign or not.  
In the case of a Feature Test campaign, a boolean value is returned based on whether a user qualifies for a campaign or not and also whether the feature is enabled for the variation assigned to that user or not.

## Description

The API method:

- Validates the parameters passed.
- Checks whether the user is whitelisted.
- Checks if User Storage Service is provided to know whether the user is returning. If yes, show the previously assigned variation always.
- Checks if the campaign is part of [Mutually Exclusive Group](https://developers.vwo.com/docs/mutually-exclusive-groups) and evaluates all the grouped campaigns to decide whether the user is eligible for the campaign.
- Checks whether the user is eligible for the campaign based on pre-segmentation conditions.
- Checks whether the user qualifies to become a part of the campaign based on traffic allocation.
- Assigns a deterministic variation to the qualified user.
- Sends an impression event to the VWO server for generating reports.
- Returns whether the feature is enabled for the user.

The API method requires a campaign unique-key _campaignKey_, feature, and a User ID - _userId_. You can also pass other flags under the _options_ key. 

_campaignKey_ is the required key provided at the time of FullStack campaign creation.  
_userId_ is the required unique id associated with the user for identification.  
_options_ is the optional key to provide targeting, whitelisting, User Storage Service stored data, and other flags based on your campaign setup and requirements.

The API method has various levels of stages and depending on each stage result, the subsequent stage is executed.

- **Parameter Validation** - first, validates the parameters passed. If these are not valid, log the error, and the API method returns null, that is, no variation found.
- **Whitelisting** - checks whether a user is forced into a variation. This could be achieved via user ID or passing custom variation targeting variables that would be evaluated against conditions configured inside the campaign on VWO app. If the user is whitelisted, variation defined in conditions is returned otherwise proceeded further.
- **Pre-segmentation** - checks whether the user passes the segmentation conditions i.e. whether the user is eligible for the campaign by evaluating campaign segmentation conditions against passed custom variables. If the user is eligible, then proceed further, otherwise return.
- **User Bucketing** - checks whether the User(_userId_) qualifies for the campaign. This is achieved by hashing the _userId_ by using the [murmur3 hashing algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MurmurHash), which always provides the same hash value for the same _userId_. This helps in maintaining consistent behavior throughout for a particular _userId_. The hash value is normalized to a number in the range 1â€“100 and is checked with the campaign _percent traffic_, which was configured at the time of campaign creation. If the hash value is less than or equal to the campaign _percent traffic_, the user is marked as being qualified for the campaign having the key as _campaignKey_. If the _userId_ is not qualified for the campaign, the API method returns false, that is, no variation assigned.

This method does take care of _UserStorageService_. It first looks into _UserStorageService_(if provided at the time of Instantiation) before the above logic executes and if the stored variation is found, it returns with that value.

- **Sending Impression** - sends an impression to the VWO server for generating reports.

## Returns

A boolean indicating whether the feature is enabled for the user.

| Value | Type    | Description                                   |
| :---- | :------ | :-------------------------------------------- |
| true  | Boolean | When a user qualifies for the feature.        |
| false | Boolean | When a user is not qualified for the feature. |

## Usage

```javascript JavaScript
// campaignKey: you provide at the time of campaign creation
// userId: how you identify a particular user
// options: (Optional)
//   customVariables: pre-segmentation variables
//   variationTargetingVariables: forced variation variables
//.  userAgent: userAgent of visitor to use segmentation on VWO
//   userIpAddress: IpAddress of visitor to use segmentation on VWO

var options = {
  customVariables: {},
  variationTargetingVariables: {},
  userAgent: '',
  userIpAddress: ''
};

var isEnabled = vwoClientInstance.isFeatureEnabled(campaignKey, userId, options);

if (isEnabled) {
  // Write code for handling feature enabled
} else {
  // CODE: User is not qualified for the campaign. Would be due to configuring campaign's percent-traffic less than 100% while creating or updating a FullStack campaign.
}
```

For passing _userStorageData_ in the options, please follow this [doc](https://developers.vwo.com/docs/is-user-storage-service-synchronous-or-asynchronous).

## Unique Visitors are tracked

If User Storage Service is provided, SDK will not track the same visitor multiple times. Once tracked and stored by the User Storage Service, the next time the same visitor lands, it will check the existence from the storage via User Storage Service. If found, it will not track the same visitor.

> ðŸš§ Note
> 
> VWO only tracks a visitor and its corresponding conversion only once even if the SDK sends multiple calls.

## When is Campaign Activation Mandatory

If [User Storage Service](https://developers.vwo.com/docs/javascript-implement-a-user-storage-service) is provided, campaign activation is mandatory before tracking any goal, getting a variation of a campaign, and getting the value of the feature's variable.

> ðŸš§ Note
> 
> Mandatory campaign activation is available from **_v1.13_** onwards.

## Passing meta-information that would be available to User Storage Service

If [User Storage Service](https://developers.vwo.com/docs/javascript-implement-a-user-storage-service) is provided, there could be cases where you would want to store some other details along with the VWO decision-related data into the storage. It is easily achievable by storing the data at your end asynchronously, while SDK will use the User Storage Service to save the decision-related data.  
Our SDKs provide a way of passing the meta-information like _browser, os, IP address, location_, etc., along with the decision-related data. The data you will provide in the API call will be available in the **_set_** method of User Storage Service, which you can use to save along with VWO SDK's decision-related data.

```javascript JavaScript
var vwoSDK = require('vwo-node-sdk');

var userStorageService = {
  get: function (userId, campaignKey) {
    // Get stored user-campaign data mapping in the format sdk passed it to set method
  },
  set: function (data) {
    // Save user-campaign data mapping
    // Access meta-data as data.metaData
  }
};

var vwoClientInstance = vwoSDK.launch({
  settingsFile: settingsFile,
  userStorageService: userStorageService 
});

const options = {
  metaData: {
    browser: 'chrome',
    os: 'linux'
  }
};

vwoClientInstance.isFeatureEnabled(campaignKey, userId, options);
```

> ðŸš§ Note
> 
> Passing meta-information is available from **_v1.13_** onwards.

## Promises and async

If your application uses promises for asynchronous operations, you can configure the SDK to manage asynchronous operations. VWO SDK is capable of returning a value as well as promise depending on the use case.  
When returning a value, API response time is faster (\< 50ms) as it does not wait for the asynchronous tracking call to get completed. in the case of returning a promise, API will wait for both the decision as well as the asynchronous tracking call to get completed, and thereby, the response time of the API will include the round-trip time of the network call.

Since the async/await syntax is based on Promises, all APIs will also work with it.

**Configuring the SDK**

You can pass **_returnPromiseFor_** option at the time of instantiating the SDK i.e. while using _launch_ API.  
The **_returnPromiseFor_** option is an object and you can use it either to enable promise-based response from all the APIs or select the required API(s).

```javascript
const vwoInstance = vwoSdk.launch({
  settingsFile,
  returnPromiseFor: {
    all: true
  }
});

// Or just for isFeatureEnabled API

const vwoInstance = vwoSdk.launch({
  settingsFile,
  returnPromiseFor: {
    isFeatureEnabled: true
  }
});
```

**Example** 

```javascript
// Using the .then() method to add a handler for a Promise
vwoClientInstance.isFeatureEnabled(campaignKey, userId).then(isEnabled => {
  // use isEnabled in your application code
});

// Using "await" instead, within an async function
const isEnabled = await vwoClientInstance.isFeatureEnabled(campaignKey, userId);
```
