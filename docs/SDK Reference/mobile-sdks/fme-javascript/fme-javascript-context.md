The **user context** serves as a unique identifier for individual users and plays a critical role in ensuring **consistent feature rollouts** across sessions and devices. Typically represented as a **object**, the user context includes an \_*id* key that uniquely identifies the user.

In addition to the user ID, the context can incorporate various ***attributes*** to support advanced targeting and segmentation strategies. These may include:

* **custom-variables**: User-specific data points for personalized experiences.
* **user-agent**: Information about the user's device, browser, or operating system.
* **ip-address**: Location-based data to enable geo-targeting.

By leveraging these attributes, organizations can deliver **precisely targeted features**, maintain **personalization consistency**, and **conduct granular experimentation** for improved user engagement and performance analysis.

> ðŸ“˜ Important Note
>
> The **user context attributes** differ from the attributes set using the ***setAttribute*** API.
>
> * **User Context Attributes**: Primarily used for **targeting purposes** during feature rollouts and experimentation. These attributes help determine which users are eligible for specific features or variations.
> * ***setAttribute* API Attributes**: Specifically designed for **post-segmentation analysis**, allowing you to segment and analyze experiment results based on defined user characteristics.

> ðŸš§ Current Limitation
>
> VWO **does not support** using **user context attributes** directly as **post-segmentation filters** in the reporting section of VWO applications. For post-segmentation, it is recommended to rely on attributes set via the *setAttribute* API.

## Usage

```node
// Define the user context object to identify and provide user-specific details
const userContext = {
  id: 'unique_user_id',
  customVariables: { age: 25, location: 'US' },
  userAgent:
    'Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/130.0.0.0 Safari/537.36',
  ipAddress: '1.1.1.1',
};

// The same user context can be used across different APIs. For example -

// Returns a flag object which can be used to get flag's status or variable(s)
const flag = await vwoClient.getFlag('feature_key', userContext);

// Track a metric conversion for the specified event-name
vwoClient.trackEvent('event-name', userContext);

// Send a user attribute to VWO
vwoClient.setAttribute('attribute-name', 'attribute-value', userContext);
```
