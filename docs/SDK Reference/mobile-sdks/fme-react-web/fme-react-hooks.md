The `VWO FME React SDK` provides a set of hooks to help you seamlessly integrate feature flagging, experimentation, and event tracking into your React application. These hooks are designed to provide an easy and flexible way to interact with the VWO SDK.

Here are the available hooks:

## useVWOClient

`useVWOClient` is a custom React hook that provides access to the initialized VWO SDK client instance within components wrapped by `VWOProvider`. It enables interaction with the VWO platform for experiments, feature flags, and tracking.

### Usage

The hook **does not** accept any parameters. It internally consumes the VWO context provided by `VWOProvider`.

```javascript
const { vwoClient, isReady } = useVWOClient();

if (isReady && vwoClient) {
  // Using vwoClient, you can run experiments, track events, and manage feature flags.
	// For example, call methods like vwoClient.getFlag(), vwoClient.trackEvent(), etc.
}
```

### Hook Lifecycle & Side Effects

* The hook internally accesses the VWO client and readiness state from the React context.
* If used outside of a `VWOProvider`, it logs an error and returns a default state with no client and `isReady: false`.
* If the context indicates the client is not ready, it returns a default state signaling the client is still initializing.
* The hook has `No side effects` (like state updates or async calls) happen inside this hook; itâ€™s purely for safe retrieval of the VWO client from context.

### Return Type

```typescript
interface VWOClientResult {
  vwoClient: IVWOClient | null;
  isReady: boolean;
}
```

* `vwoClient`: The VWO SDK client instance if initialized; otherwise null.
* `isReady`: Boolean indicating whether the VWO client is fully initialized and ready for use.

## useGetFlag

The `useGetFlag` hook is used to retrieve a feature flag and check its status. It also provides access to associated variables.

* **Usage**: Retrieve the flag and check if it is enabled for the current user.

## useGetFlagVariable

The `useGetFlagVariable` hook allows you to fetch a specific variable associated with a feature flag.

* **Usage**: Retrieve the value of a specific feature flag variable.
* **More Info**: [Learn more about useGetFlagVariable](https://developers.vwo.com/v2/docs/fme-react-feature-flags-variables#usegetflagvariable-hook)

## useGetFlagVariables

The `useGetFlagVariable` hook allows you to fetch all variables associated with a feature flag.

* **Usage**: Retrieve all feature flag variables.

## useTrackEvent

The `useTrackEvent` hook allows you to track custom events within your app, such as user actions or conversions.

* **Usage**: Track important metrics, such as button clicks or completed purchases.
* **More Info**: [Learn more about useTrackEvent](https://developers.vwo.com/v2/docs/fme-react-metrics-tracking#usetrackevent-hook)

## useSetAttribute

The `useSetAttribute` hook provides a simple way to associate these attributes with users in VWO for advanced segmentation.

* **Usage**: Assign user attributes to help with segmentation and personalization.
