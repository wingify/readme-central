The **user context** serves as a unique identifier for individual users and plays a critical role in ensuring **consistent feature rollouts** across sessions and devices. Typically represented as an **object**, the user context includes an *id* key that uniquely identifies the user.

In addition to the user ID, the context can incorporate various ***attributes*** to support advanced targeting and segmentation strategies. These may include:

* **customVariables**: User-specific data points for personalized experiences.

By leveraging these attributes, organizations can deliver **precisely targeted features**, maintain **personalization consistency**, and **conduct granular experimentation** for improved user engagement and performance analysis.

> ðŸ“˜ Important Note
>
> The **user context attributes** differ from the attributes set using the ***setAttribute*** API.
>
> * **User Context Attributes**: Primarily used for **targeting purposes** during feature rollouts and experimentation. These attributes help determine which users are eligible for specific features or variations.
> * ***setAttribute* API Attributes**: Specifically designed for **post-segmentation analysis**, allowing you to segment and analyze experiment results based on defined user characteristics.

> ðŸš§ Current Limitation
>
> VWO **does not support** using **user context attributes** directly as **post-segmentation filters** in the reporting section of VWO applications. For post-segmentation, it is recommended to rely on attributes set via the *setAttribute* API.

## Usage

```javascript JavaScript
import { VWOProvider } from 'vwo-fme-react-sdk';

const vwoConfig = {
  sdkKey: '32-alpha-numeric-sdk-key',  // Your VWO SDK Key
  accountId: '123456',  // Your VWO Account ID
};

const userContext = {
  id: 'unique_user_id',  // Required: Unique identifier for the user
  customVariables: {     // Optional
    age: 25,
    location: 'US',
  }
};

// Here passing userContext is optional. You can also pass this in useGetFlag hook.
const App = () => (
  <VWOProvider config={vwoConfig} userContext={userContext}>
    <YourComponent />
  </VWOProvider>
);

export default App;
```
