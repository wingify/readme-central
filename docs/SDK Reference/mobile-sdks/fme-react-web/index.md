The VWO FME React SDK empowers developers to integrate feature flags, conduct A/B testing, and personalize user experiences within React applications. This SDK facilitates controlled feature rollouts, real-time experimentation, and data-driven decision-making to enhance application performance and user engagement.

### Source Code Repository

The SDK's source code is openly available under the Apache 2.0 License and can be accessed on [GitHub](https://github.com/wingify/vwo-fme-react-sdk)

### Navigating the SDK Documentation

To facilitate a comprehensive understanding and effective implementation of the SDK, the documentation is organized into the following sections:

1. [Installing the SDK](doc:fme-react-install)\
   Learn how to import and reference the SDK in your React.js project.
2. [Initialization](doc:fme-react-initialization)\
   Learn how to initialize the VWO client within your application, including configuring essential parameters such as accountId, sdkKey, and optional settings like pollInterval, logger, storage, gatewayService, and integrations.
3. [User Context](doc:fme-react-context)\
