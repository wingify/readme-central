The **user context** serves as a unique identifier for individual users and plays a critical role in ensuring **consistent feature rollouts** across sessions and devices. Typically represented as a **object**, the user context includes an _id_ key that uniquely identifies the user.

In addition to the user ID, the context can incorporate various _**attributes**_ to support advanced targeting and segmentation strategies. This includes **custom-variables** that are User-specific data points for personalized experiences.

By leveraging these attributes, organizations can deliver **precisely targeted features**, maintain **personalization consistency**, and **conduct granular experimentation** for improved user engagement and performance analysis.

> ðŸ“˜ Important Note
> 
> The **user context attributes** differ from the attributes set using the **_setAttribute_** API.
> 
> - **User Context Attributes**: Primarily used for **targeting purposes** during feature rollouts and experimentation. These attributes help determine which users are eligible for specific features or variations.
> - **_setAttribute_ API Attributes**: Specifically designed for **post-segmentation analysis**, allowing you to segment and analyze experiment results based on defined user characteristics.

> ðŸš§ Current Limitation
> 
> VWO **does not support** using **user context attributes** directly as **post-segmentation filters** in the reporting section of VWO applications. For post-segmentation, it is recommended to rely on attributes set via the _setAttribute_ API.

## Usage

```swift Dart
// Define the user context object to identify and provide user-specific details
final vwoContext = VWOContext(
  'id': userId,
  'customVariables': {'age': 24, 'location': 'US'},
};

// The same user context can be used across different APIs. For example -

// Returns a flag object which can be used to get flag's status or variable(s)
final GetFlag? flag = await vwoClient?.getFlag(
  flagName: flagName,
  vwoContext: vwoContext,
);

// Track a metric conversion for the specified event-name
final trackingResult = await vwoClient?.trackEvent(
  eventName: eventName,
  context: userContext
);

// Send a user attribute to VWO
final attributeMap = VWOContext(
  'userType': 'paid'
};
final success = await vwoClient?.setAttribute(
	attributeMap,
	context: userContext,
);
```
