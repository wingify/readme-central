Setting up the environment for your application is critical. We strongly recommend you to use this setting carefully. The default environment is set to **production**, which means that the VWO SDK will send events to the VWO server for tracking visitors and conversions along with actions like bucketing variation, checking eligibility of a user to become part of a campaign, assigning a variation to a user, and so on.

        Environment
      </th>

      <th style={{ textAlign: "left" }}>

      <th style={{ textAlign: "left" }}>
        Default

    </tr>
  </thead>

  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td style={{ textAlign: "left" }}>
        isDevelopmentMode
      </td>

      <td style={{ textAlign: "left" }}>
        Boolean
      </td>

      <td style={{ textAlign: "left" }}>
        false
      </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</Table>

> ðŸš§ NOTE

> You must set the environment to ***isDevelopmentMode: true*** if you're experimenting with the SDK.

```python
import vwo

settings_file = vwo.get_settings_file(account_id, sdk_key)

vwo_client_instance = vwo.launch(settings_file, is_development_mode=True)
```
