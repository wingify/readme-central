An **OpenFeature Provider** is a **pluggable integration layer** that connects the **OpenFeature SDK** to a specific **feature flag management system** (e.g., VWO or custom in-house solutions). OpenFeature is an open-source standard for feature flagging, designed to provide a **vendor-agnostic** approach, enabling organizations to switch between feature flagging tools without rewriting application code.

VWO supports the following Openfeature providers
