## Overview of CI/CD and GitHub Actions

**CI/CD (Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery/Deployment)** is a set of practices in software development aimed at automating and streamlining the process of integrating, testing, and deploying code. Continuous Integration involves automatically integrating and testing code changes frequently to detect issues early, while Continuous Delivery ensures that the code is always in a deployable state, ready for manual release. Continuous Deployment takes this a step further by automatically deploying every change to production once it passes testing. Together, CI/CD improves software quality, speeds up development cycles, and reduces the risk of errors in production by ensuring that code is continuously tested and delivered in a seamless, automated workflow.

**GitHub Actions** is a powerful automation feature within the GitHub platform that enables the creation and execution of workflows for tasks such as Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Delivery (CD). It allows developers to define custom workflows to automate processes like testing, building, and deploying applications directly within the GitHub environment.

Key components of **GitHub Actions**:

1. **Workflows**:\
   A GitHub Actions workflow is a YAML file (located in the `.github/workflows/` directory of your repository) that defines the steps and jobs to be run. A workflow can be triggered by specific events, like pushing code to a branch, creating a pull request, or on a schedule.
2. **Actions**:\
   Actions are individual tasks that can be run as part of a workflow. GitHub provides a marketplace for reusable actions created by the community. You can use pre-made actions or write custom actions for specific tasks (e.g., testing, deployment).
3. **Jobs**:\
   Jobs define a set of steps that are executed on the same runner (an environment where your code is built, tested, and deployed). Jobs can run sequentially or in parallel, depending on your configuration.
4. **Events**:\
   An event is a specific activity in a repository that triggers a workflow run. For example, an activity can originate from GitHub when someone creates a pull request, opens an issue, or pushes a commit to a repository

## Introduction to VWO FME Github Action

The **VWO FME GitHub Action** enables you to evaluate feature flags in your CI/CD pipelines using the **VWO platform** (Visual Website Optimizer). It allows you to dynamically enable or disable features or retrieve feature flag values during the build process. By leveraging feature flags, you can make more flexible, robust, and dynamic applications, eliminating hardcoded values from the codebase.

This documentation provides a comprehensive guide to understand how to set up and use the VWO FME GitHub Action in your repository.

## Inputs

The following input fields need to be provided when using the `VWO FME GitHub Action`.

| Input Name             | Description                                                                                                                                                                                               | Required |
| :--------------------- | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :------- |
| **flagsWithVariables** | A JSON object containing feature flag keys and their default values. This allows you to evaluate multiple feature flags with associated variables. Example: `{"featureA": {"variableA": "defaultValue"}}` | Yes      |
| **userContext**        | A JSON object describing the context of the user for whom the feature flag needs to be evaluated. This helps determine which flag state the user should receive. Example: `{"id": "userId"}`              | Yes      |
| **sdkInitOptions**     | An optional JSON object for configuring the VWO SDK. This could include logger settings, network options, etc. Example: `{"logger": {"level": "DEBUG"}}`                                                  | No       |

## Outputs

The action will provide the following outputs that can be referenced in subsequent steps of your GitHub Actions workflow.

| Output Name              | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| :----------------------- | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **flagKey**              | The status of the evaluated feature flag, either `true` or `false`. Example: `${{ steps.vwo_action.outputs.featureA }}`. This represents the result of the flag evaluation.                                |
| **flagKey\_variableKey** | The value of the associated variable for the feature flag. Example: `${{ steps.vwo_action.outputs.featureA_variableA }}`. This allows you to get the value assigned for variables inside the feature flag. |

> Note: The output keys (`flagKey` and `flagKey_variableKey`) are dynamic and will change based on the feature flags you're working with. For example, if your feature flag is named `featureA`, you can access its status as `${{ steps.vwo_action.outputs.featureA }}` and the variable value as `${{ steps.vwo_action.outputs.featureA_variableA }}`.

## Environment Variables

The action requires the following environment variables to be set for the VWO SDK initialization:

| Environment Variable | Description                                                                                                           | Required |
| :------------------- | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :------- |
| **VWO\_SDK\_KEY**    | The SDK key is used to initialize the VWO SDK. This key is required for the action to interact with the VWO platform. | Yes      |
| **VWO\_ACCOUNT\_ID** | The account ID of the VWO project. This ID is used to identify the VWO account associated with the feature flags.     | Yes      |

You should store the `VWO_SDK_KEY` and `VWO_ACCOUNT_ID` securely in your GitHub repositoryâ€™s secrets (e.g., `${{ secrets.VWO_SDK_KEY }})`.

## Usage Example

Below is an example of how to use the VWO FME GitHub Action in a GitHub Actions workflow:

```yaml
name: Feature Flag Management

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main

jobs:
  feature-flag-evaluation:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Evaluate Feature Flags
        uses: wingify/vwo-fme-github-action@v1.1.0
        with:
          flagsWithVariables: |
            {
              "feature-flag-key-1": {
                "variable-key-1": "variable-default-value"
              },
              "feature-flag-key-2": {
                "variable-key-1": "variable-default-value"
              }
            }
          userContext: |
            {
              "id": "your-user-id"
            }
          sdkInitOptions: |
            {
              "logger": {
                "level": "DEBUG"
              }
            }
        env:
          VWO_SDK_KEY: ${{ secrets.VWO_SDK_KEY }}
          VWO_ACCOUNT_ID: ${{ secrets.VWO_ACCOUNT_ID }}

```

Explanation:

* The workflow is triggered on a `push` event to the `main` branch.
* The `Evaluate Feature Flags` step uses the `VWO FME GitHub Action` to evaluate the feature flags for a user with the specified context (`userContext`).
* Feature flags are specified in the `flagsWithVariables` input as JSON, where each key represents a feature flag and its associated variable values.
* The `sdkInitOptions` input allows for optional SDK configuration.
* The VWO SDK credentials (`VWO_SDK_KEY` and `VWO_ACCOUNT_ID`) are passed securely using GitHub secrets.
