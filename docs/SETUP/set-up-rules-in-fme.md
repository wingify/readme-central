So, you've set up a feature flag in VWO and put it in your code. The next step is deciding who sees that feature and how.

Do you want to show it randomly to a small percentage of users at first, or maybe test different versions? Or do you want to show it only to a certain segment of users?

Thatâ€™s where rules come into play.

### What are rules?

Think of rules as the gatekeepers for your feature flag. You set up conditions, and these rules check each user against those conditions to decide:

* Should this user see the feature at all?
* If they do see it, which version should they get? (This is key for A/B tests or personalized experiences).

Rules let you specify who sees what, so you can include or exclude anyone from your feature rollout, test, or personalization campaign.
