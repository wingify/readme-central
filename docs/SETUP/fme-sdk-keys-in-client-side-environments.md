VWOâ€™s FME SDKs allow you to run experiments and feature rollouts in any environment â€” web, mobile, or backend. However, when using VWO in client-side environments (e.g., browsers or mobile apps), you're required to expose your Account ID and SDK Key, which may raise security concerns.

This document outlines best practices for safely using VWO SDK Keys on the client-side and when you should consider using a server-side or proxy-based model instead.

## What is a VWO SDK Key?

* A **VWO SDK Key** is used to initialize the FME SDK and authenticate with VWO servers to fetch feature flags and experiment configurations.
* It is **not a secret**, but it should be treated with care. Anyone with access to it can fetch variation assignments and feature flags, although they **cannot modify experiments** or access your VWO account settings.

> ðŸ“˜ Note
>
> The SDK Key is read-only and only used to fetch your FME feature flag configurations, so its exposure doesn't pose a direct security risk. However, VWO strongly advises against storing any personally identifiable information (PII) in your flag configurations.

<br />

## What Happens If an SDK Key is Exposed?

SDK keys are often embedded in the frontend code when using VWO FME in the browser or with mobile clients. While this is supported, consider the security implications:

| Risk                           | Impact                                                                |
| ------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Key reuse in unauthorized apps | 3rd parties may use your SDK Key to access experiment variations      |
| Traffic abuse                  | Excessive requests could lead to rate limits or increased costs       |
| User impersonation             | Malicious actors may simulate end users if they know user identifiers |

## Best Practices for Using SDK Key in Client-Side Apps

### 1. Use Environment-Specific SDK Keys

When working with VWO FME, it's important to isolate environments to reduce risk and maintain control over your feature flag configurations. VWO provides you with default multiple environments (such as `development`, `staging`, and `production`) within your project, each with its own unique SDK Key.

#### ðŸ’¡ Best Practice for Client-Side Usage

For client-side integrations, especially in web browsers where the SDK Key is publicly exposed, you should go one step further:

* **Create a dedicated environment** (e.g., named `client-side`) within your VWO Default project.
* **Restrict this environment** so that only feature flags intended for use in browser-based applications are enabled within it.
* **Avoid including any server-side or mobile-specific flags** in this environment to prevent unintended exposure.

By doing this, the SDK Key associated with the `client-side` **environment** will only fetch configurations relevant to the frontend, reducing the risk of exposing internal or sensitive features that are meant for backend or mobile contexts.

#### Benefits

* **Tighter security**: Even if the SDK Key is exposed (which is expected on the client), it only has access to safe, client-appropriate configurations.
* **Better control**: You can independently manage rollout strategies and permissions for client vs. server environments.
* **Easier debugging**: Isolating environments makes it easier to track down environment-specific issues during development.

```javascript
const vwoClient = init({
  accountId: '123456',
  sdkKey: 'dev-xyz-456', // Use enviroment-specific keys
});
```
```javascript React.js
import { VWOProvider } from 'vwo-fme-react-sdk';

const vwoConfig = {
  sdkKey: 'your-sdk-key', // Replace with your SDK Key
  accountId: 'your-account-id', // Replace with your Account ID
  logger: {
    level: 'info', // Optional: Set log level
  },
};

function App() {
  return (
    <VWOProvider config={vwoConfig}>
      {/* Your application components */}
    </VWOProvider>
  );
}
```

### 2. Avoid Hardcoding the SDK Key in Source Code

Use environment variables and inject them securely at build time via your CI/CD pipeline.

```shell
# .env.production
VWO_ACCOUNT_ID=123456
VWO_SDK_KEY=prod-abc-123
```

```javascript
const vwoClient = init({
  accountId: process.env.VWO_ACCOUNT_ID,
  sdkKey: process.env.VWO_SDK_KEY,
});
```
```javascript React.js
import { VWOProvider } from 'vwo-fme-react-sdk';

const vwoConfig = {
  accountId: process.env.VWO_ACCOUNT_ID,
  sdkKey: process.env.VWO_SDK_KEY
};

function App() {
  return (
    <VWOProvider config={vwoConfig}>
      {/* Your application components */}
    </VWOProvider>
  );
}
```

### 3. Use Secure Connections (HTTPS)

Ensure your app only communicates over HTTPS to prevent man-in-the-middle attacks that could intercept SDK Key traffic.

### 4. Donâ€™t Expose Internal User Identifiers

Always hash or anonymize user identifiers on the client-side:

```javascript
const hashedUserId = sha256(user.email); // Never use raw emails or PII
const flag = vwoClient.getFlag('flag_key', { id: hashedUserId });
```

> ðŸš§ Limitations of Client-Side SDK Usage

| Limitation           | Implication                                |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| SDK Key exposure     | Public key can be used to fetch variations |
| PII risk             | User info may leak if not anonymized       |
| No server validation | Cannot enforce access controls             |
| Slower performance   | Network requests add latency               |

<br />

## Alternative: Server-Side Bootstrapping

To reduce exposure and improve control, consider bootstrapping your client SDKs from the server:

### Flow

* Client sends user info to your backend (secure).
* Backend initializes the SDK using the features flag configuration
* Backend returns configuration to the client(eg, browser).
  * (Optional)Evaluate flags on the server side and return them to the client.
* Client uses configuration or even pre-evaluated flags(no SDK Key needed).

### Example

```javascript Node.js
import {init} from 'vwo-fme-node-sdk';

const vwoClient = init({
  accountId: process.env.VWO_ACCOUNT_ID,
  sdkKey: process.env.VWO_SDK_KEY,
});

const flag = vwoClient.getFlag('flag_key', { id: hashedUserId });
const isFlagEnabled = flag.isEnabled();
const variableValues = flag.variables();
```

Then send that flag result/variable values to the frontend either via `cookies` or setting on `window`object.

| -------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Rotate SDK Keys      | Regenerate SDK keys periodically or upon suspected misuse                           |
| Monitor usage        | Use network monitoring tools or VWOâ€™s dashboards to track API calls                 |
| Rate limit via proxy | If using a server-side proxy, add rate limits and throttling                        |
| Obfuscate code       | For web apps, consider bundling and obfuscating JS code to make key scraping harder |
