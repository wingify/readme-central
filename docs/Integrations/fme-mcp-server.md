## Introduction

The `VWO MCP Server` serves as a seamless bridge between your development environment and VWOâ€™s Feature Management & Experimentation. It enables effortless feature flag management by integrating directly with AI-powered IDEs, allowing you to control and optimize feature releases without disrupting your coding workflow.

### Key Features

* **AI Assistant Integration**: Compatible with tools such as `Cursor`, `VS Code`, and `Claude`.
* **Feature Flag Management**: Enables the creation, reading, updating, and deletion of feature flags.
* **Environment Control**: Offers flexibility to enable or disable features in different environments.

This is ideal for developers who want to manage feature flags efficiently within their IDEs.

<br />

## Required Configuration

To connect the MCP server to the VWO feature management system, you must configure two essential environment variables:

* **VWO\_ACCOUNT\_ID**: VWO Account ID.
* **VWO\_API\_KEY**: The API key (Developer Token) for authenticating with VWO REST APIs.

## Setup Instructions

To begin using the **VWO MCP server** with your client, follow the setup instructions below for popular tools.

### Cursor

1. Open **Cursor Settings** and navigate to the **MCP** section.
2. Click on **Add new global MCP server**.
3. Add the following configuration in `mcp.json`, ensuring that you replace the placeholder values with your actual credentials:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "vwo-mcp-server": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "vwo-fme-mcp@latest"],
      "env": {
        "VWO_ACCOUNT_ID": "VWO_ACCOUNT_ID",
        "VWO_API_KEY": "VWO_API_KEY"
      }
    }
  }
}

```

4. Save the configuration and confirm that the server status turns green, indicating it's active.

    "vwo-mcp-server": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "vwo-fme-mcp@latest"],
      "env": {
        "VWO_ACCOUNT_ID": "VWO_ACCOUNT_ID",
        "VWO_API_KEY": "VWO_API_KEY"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

3. Save the settings and ensure the MCP server is ready for use within VS Code.

      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "vwo-fme-mcp@latest"],
      "env": {
        "VWO_ACCOUNT_ID": "VWO_ACCOUNT_ID",
        "VWO_API_KEY": "VWO_API_KEY"
