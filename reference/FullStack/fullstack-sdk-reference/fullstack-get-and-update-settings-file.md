Once the SDK is launched properly, there might be scenarios later on when you need to fetch the latest settings-file and use that instead of the stale one to sync SDK and VWO application. You can do this by calling [Get Settings File](https://developers.vwo.com/reference#fullstack-get-settings) API and passing the fetched settings-file to the [Launch](https://developers.vwo.com/reference#fullstack-sdk-instantiation) API to re-instantiate the VWO SDK. Or, you can simply use the Get and Update Settings File API, available on the VWO Client Instance that is already available.

## Description

**Get And Update Settings File** API will fetch the latest settings-file from the VWO server and update the VWO Client Instance to use that. Every VWO SDK API used after this API will work according to the latest settings-file fetched.

The method accepts three parameters:

* **accountId** - account-id associated with your VWO account.
* **sdkKey** - generated inside the respective *Project* under the ***FullStack Testing***.
