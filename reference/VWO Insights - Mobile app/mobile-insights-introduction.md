VWO Insights helps a user analyze the behavior of application users based on their actions such as application launch, taps, scroll, fling, etc. The idea is to attribute some of these actions to business-critical events like purchases, sign-ups, etc- which can be considered a conversion. Based on analyzing such behavior, users can identify problem areas of the application due to which users are not converting. Insights help with the research stage of experience optimization- to understand what users are (not) doing on the application and figure out why they are (not) doing it. It provides the different directions in which a website can be optimized. 

Proper research and insight generation is the bedrock of a good optimization program. It leaves little to assumption and guides the user to perform data-backed ideation and testing.
