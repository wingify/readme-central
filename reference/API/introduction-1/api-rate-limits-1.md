We rate limit 1 request per second for every token. Applications are not rate limited, though the limit is applied upon the token generated for an account. If the application users/VWO users intend to use the API beyond the rate limits mentioned, then please drop us a mail at [api@vwo.com](mailto:api@vwo.com) with your requirement details.
