Workspace threshold values indicate the level of confidence you can have on a variation to perform better as compared to the control (original) version of a website. VWO determines a winning variation in a campaign by calculating the Chance to beat original (CTBO) metric. The level of confidence in a variation is indicated by a value between 0%-100 percent.

You can set the threshold for winning variation, losing variation, and minimum visitors required to calculate which variation wins or loses.
