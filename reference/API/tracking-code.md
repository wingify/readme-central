The [VWO SmartCode](https://vwo.com/why-us/technology/vwo-smartcode/) snippet that you add to your pages contacts VWO server whenever a visitor lands on a test page. The server sends its response in two parts - static JavaScript code for running the test and dynamic test-specific data. Both the static and dynamic parts of the response are cached heavily at the server back-end, thereby minimizing the response time. With code minification and gzipping, the size of response decreases even further.
