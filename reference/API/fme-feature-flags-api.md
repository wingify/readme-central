The Feature Management and Experimentation (FME) REST APIs provide developers with the ability to programmatically manage feature flags. Using these APIs, you can perform the full set of CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on feature flag resources. Specifically, you can:

- Create a new feature flag with predefined configurations
- Retrieve detailed information about a specific feature flag
- Update an existing feature flag, including its name, status, or associated rules
- Delete a feature flag that is no longer needed
- List all feature flags within your environment to get an overview of what is currently available

This level of access enables automation and integration of feature flag management into your development and deployment workflows, supporting best practices like continuous delivery and infrastructure as code.

> **These APIs are applicable only to the [Feature Management and Experimentation](https://developers.vwo.com/v2/docs/fme-overview)(FME) Product.** Ensure your project is configured accordingly before making API requests.
