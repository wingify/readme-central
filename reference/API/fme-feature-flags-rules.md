The Feature Management and Experimentation (FME) REST APIs also enable developers to manage feature flag rules programmatically. Feature flag rules define how and when a feature is delivered to usersâ€”based on conditions such as audience segmentation, rollout percentages, or experiment variations.

Using the APIs, you can:

- Create a new rule for an existing feature flag, including rollout, A/B test, or personalization logic
- Retrieve the configuration details of a specific feature flag rule
- Update an existing rule to reflect changes in targeting strategy or experiment design
- Delete a rule that is no longer required
- List all rules associated with a given feature flag to get a complete view of its behavior and targeting logic

This API access provides fine-grained control over how features are rolled out and tested, enabling teams to dynamically adjust their strategies without relying on the user interface.
